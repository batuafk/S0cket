# Socket

Network Socket: In computing, this is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. Itâ€™s often used in programming to enable communication between applications over a network.

Components of a Network Socket
	IP Address: Identifies the networked device.
		IPv4: Consists of four octets separated by dots, e.g., 192.168.1.1.
		IPv6: Uses a longer format with hexadecimal digits separated by colons, e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
	Port Number: Identifies the specific application or service on the device.
		Well-Known Ports: 0 to 1023 (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443).
		Registered Ports: 1024 to 49151 (e.g., MySQL uses port 3306).
		Dynamic/Private Ports: 49152 to 65535 (used for ephemeral ports assigned temporarily for client-side connections).
	Protocol: Defines the rules for data transmission, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

Stream Sockets (TCP):
	Use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to provide a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel.
	Ensure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.
	Suitable for applications requiring guaranteed delivery.
		Web browsers (HTTP/HTTPS)
		Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
		File transfers (FTP)

Datagram Sockets (UDP):
	Use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for connectionless communication.
	Data is sent without establishing a connection, and there is no guarantee of delivery or order.
	Suitable for applications where speed is crucial and occasional data loss is acceptable.
		Streaming media (video/audio)
		Online games
		DNS queries
